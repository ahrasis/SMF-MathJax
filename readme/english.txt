MathJax is an open source JavaScript display engine for mathematics that works in all modern browsers.

High-quality typography. MathJaxTM uses modern CSS and web fonts, instead of equation images or Flash, so equations scale with surrounding text at all zoom levels. See how this works in the scaling math demo.

Works in all modern browsers. This allows the math in your content to be seen clearly by virtually all readers, even those using smart phones. See supported browsers.

Simple integration. Using MathJax with blogs, wikis, web pages and other web apps is easy. Learn more about installing MathJax with popular platforms like WordPress, MediaWiki, Drupal, and more.

Copy and paste math. Let readers copy equations from your web pages into Word and LaTeX documents, science blogs, research wikis, calculation software like Maple, Mathematica and more. Watch the copy and paste demo.

A rich API. Allows developers to create interactive course materials, advanced authoring tools, and math-enabled web apps. Learn how more about programming with MathJax.

Accessible math. MathJax is compatible with screenreaders used by people with vision disabilities, and the Zoom feature allows all readers to see small details like scripts, primes and hats. See how to make your math accessible.
